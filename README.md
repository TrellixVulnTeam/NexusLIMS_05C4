# Welcome to NexusLIMS

The project serves as the development space for the ODI Nexus Microscopy Facility
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The top level of the repository
holds a number of folders with files of various interest, but the majority of the
code that runs the LIMS system is contained within the [`nexusLIMS`](mdcs/nexusLIMS)
package. Additional information can be found in the
[project wiki](https://***REMOVED***%{project_path}/wikis/home).

To contribute, please [fork](https://***REMOVED***%{project_path}/forks/new)
the repository, develop your addition on a
[feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
within your forked repo,
and submit a [merge request](https://***REMOVED***%{project_path}/merge_requests)
to the [`master`](https://***REMOVED***%{project_path}/tree/%{default_branch}) 
branch to have it included in the project.
